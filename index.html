        <h1>This is a minimal example how to use surveyVisualizing.js </h1>
        The visualization is based on following requirements:
        <ul>
            <li>The chart has to be included in a web page where the size of the chart can be changed easily.</li>
            <li>The chart has to include the distribution of all answers.</li>
            <li>The chart has to show how many answers are given per option and in total.</li>
            <li>The chart has to highlight the most answered option.</li>
        </ul>
        In order to meet the requirements following decissions are made:

        <ul>
            <li>To include it in a webpage the JavaScript library d3js is used. To make the char size independent d3js generates SVG charts.</li>
            <li>Each answer is respected by one rectangle.</li>
            <li>To count all given answers the amount of rectangles included in the chart can be counted.</li>
            <li>The most answered option is given by another color.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Two examples are given below</h1>  

        <h3> Question 1:
        <svg id ="q1"  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="200px" height="200px" viewBox="0 0 100 130"></svg>
        </h3>

        <h3> Question 2:
            <svg id ="q2"  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="400px" height="400px" viewBox="0 0 100 130"></svg>
        </h3>

        <script type="text/javascript">

         var rectangleColorMaxAnswerdOption = "#ffed00"; // the color of the rectangles for the most answered option
         var rectangleColorOtherOptions = "#87888a"; // the color of the rectangles for all other options


         var answersQ1 = [0,0,4,4,3]; // there are five possible options how a question can be answered. The amount of given answers is respected by the numbers, for example option 1 is answered zero times, option 2 is answered zero times too. The amount ranges from zero to ten.  
         visualizeAnswers(d3.select('#q1'), answersQ1,rectangleColorMaxAnswerdOption,rectangleColorOtherOptions);

         var answersQ2 = [7,1,2,1,0];
         visualizeAnswers(d3.select('#q2'), answersQ2,rectangleColorMaxAnswerdOption,rectangleColorOtherOptions);
